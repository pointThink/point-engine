This is an old project i was working on. It was officially abandoned because the code got stupidly messy so i decided to make the code public. Maybe some one finds this useful

# PointEngine
PointEngine is a general purpose library for making games in C++.
Right now it only supports Windows, but Linux support is planned.

# BUILDING THE ENGINE
1. Open the command prompt
2. Recursively clone the repo
3. Create a build folder inside the repository
4. Go to the build folder and run "cmake .." with your project generator of choice
5. Once that's finished you can open the project or run "cmake -- build ." to build it
